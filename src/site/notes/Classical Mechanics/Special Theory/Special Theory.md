# Galilean Relativity/ **Galilean invariance**

- the laws of motion are the same in all [inertial frames of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference "Inertial frame of reference")

# Limitations of Newtonian Mechanics

- **Handling of Constraints**:
  - Constraints in systems can complicate the analysis and predictions.

- **Galilean Invariance**:
  - Galilean invariance (Newtonian relativity) is violated by electromagnetic phenomena.
  - This leads to the development of the Special Theory of Relativity.

- **Stability of Atoms**:
  - The stability of atoms cannot be explained by classical physics.
  - This limitation leads us to ultimate brainfuck , please clap for quantum mechanics.

# Reasons & Postulates of Special Theory of Relativity

- **Electromagnetic Phenomena**:
  - The electromagnetic wave equation is not Galilean invariant.
  - Observations of the same phenomena differ in different inertial frames.

- **Moving Coil and Magnet**:
  - When a magnet is at rest, its magnetic field exerts forces on charges in a moving coil, generating current:
  $$
  \text{Force} = q(\vec{v} \times \vec{B})
  $$
  
- **Moving Magnet and Coil**:
  - When a coil is at rest and a magnet moves, the time-varying magnetic flux creates an electric field on charges, described by Faraday's Law of induction:
  $$
  \text{Motive EMF} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}
  $$

- **Speed of Light**:
  - The speed of light is the **same** in all inertial frames, supported by experimental evidence.

# Postulates of Special Theory of Relativity (Einstein, 1905)

1. **Same Physical Laws**:
   - The same physical laws apply in all inertial frames.

2. **Constant Speed of Light**:
   - The speed of light has the same value in all inertial frames.
