## Generalized Coordinates

In classical mechanics, **generalized coordinates** are a set of coordinates used to describe the configuration of a system in terms of its degrees of freedom.

Instead of using standard Cartesian coordinates, which may be cumbersome(PS:- idk why but like that's what old folks say about solving complex system) for systems with constraints, generalized coordinates allow us to describe the motion of a system with a smaller set of variables. These coordinates are denoted as $q_i$ (where $i = 1, 2, 3, \dots, N$), and their time derivatives $\dot{q}_i$ represent the generalized velocities.

### Degrees of Freedom:
The number of generalized coordinates needed is equal to the number of degrees of freedom of the system. For example:
- A particle moving in 3D space has three degrees of freedom, so we can choose $q_1 = x$, $q_2 = y$, and $q_3 = z$.
- A pendulum constrained to move in a plane has one degree of freedom, so we might choose $q_1 = \theta$, the angle the pendulum makes with the vertical.

### Lagrangian in Generalized Coordinates:
The **Lagrangian** is typically expressed in terms of generalized coordinates and their velocities:

$$
L = L(q_i, \dot{q}_i, t)
$$

This generalization allows us to apply the principles of mechanics to systems with complex geometries and constraints.

- look [[Classical Mechanics/Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Dynamics/Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Dynamics\|Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Dynamics]] for how generalized coordinates are used in the action.
- look [[Classical Mechanics/Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Dynamics/Euler-Lagrange Equation\|Euler-Lagrange Equation]] for how generalized coordinates help us to get equations of motion.
