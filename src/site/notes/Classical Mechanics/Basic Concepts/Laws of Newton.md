# $1^{st}$ Law 

- Intertia
- Interial Frames
- An object travels at a constant speed with zero acceleration in the absence of forces.

# $2^{nd}$ Law

- Rate of change of momentum equals the net external force on the
object.
$$\frac{d(m.\dot r)}{dt}= F_{external}$$

# $3^{rd}$ Law

- The reaction is equal and opposite to action.
