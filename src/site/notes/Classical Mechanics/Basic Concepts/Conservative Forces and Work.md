# Conservative Forces and Potential Energy

- If the force is conservative, i.e. $\vec{F}(\vec{r}) = -\nabla U(\vec{r})$, then:
$$
W = \int_{1}^{2} (-\nabla U) \cdot d\vec{r} = -(U_2 - U_1)
$$

- Thus, conservative forces have an associated potential energy function $U$. For conservative forces, we see that work $W$ is path-independent, depending only on end-point potential energies:
$$
W = K_2 - K_1 = -(U_2 - U_1)
$$

- Therefore, the Law of Conservation of Mechanical Energy states:
$$
K_1 + U_1 = K_2 + U_2
$$
