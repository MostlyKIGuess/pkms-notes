# Work and Kinetic Energy

- Work done on an object by application of external force $\vec{F}(t)$ is given by:
$$
W = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \vec{F}(t) \cdot d\vec{r}(t)
$$

- Using Newton's Second Law, we have:
$$
W = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} \cdot \vec{v}(t) dt = \frac{1}{2} mv^2_2 - \frac{1}{2} mv^2_1 = K_2 - K_1
$$

- Defining $K = \frac{1}{2} mv^2$ as kinetic energy, we see that the force acting on the system changes the kinetic energy of the system.
