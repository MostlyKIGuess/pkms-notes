# Development of Sociology in India

## Phase I: Colonial Modernity and Anthropology (Roughly Pre-Independence)

### The Split
* A key feature was the artificial distinction: **Sociology** was practiced *in Europe* (studying their own complex, modern society), while **Anthropology** was practiced *in the colonies* (studying 'other', supposedly static, traditional, 'primitive' societies).

### Master Narratives
* This split was based on colonial ideologies:
  * Belief in Western superiority and progress.
  * The idea that the West represented history, reason, and science, while the East (like India) represented nature, religion, and timeless tradition.

### Anthropology as 'Handmaiden of Colonialism'
* Colonial rulers needed knowledge about the people they ruled to govern effectively (taxation, control, resource extraction).
* Anthropologists (often colonial officers initially, later trained specialists) provided this knowledge.
* Their studies often portrayed colonial societies as **static, traditional, unchanging, and fragmented** (into castes, tribes, etc.), justifying colonial rule as a modernizing or stabilizing force.
* **Categorization and Classification:** 
  * A major activity was classifying people into distinct groups (castes, tribes, religious communities)
  * Used methods like the **Census, ethnographic surveys, and even pseudoscientific anthropometry**
  * This often ignored the fluidity and interdependence between groups
  * The **Gazetteer excerpts** are examples of this colonial gaze â€“ describing locals ('aborigines') as destructive, superstitious, and classifying their religious practices
* **Spatial-Cultural Zones:** Mapping regions and linking them to specific cultural groups helped in administration.
* **The Village View:** Villages were often depicted as isolated, self-sufficient units where castes lived in fixed harmony, ignoring wider connections and conflicts.

### Impact of Theories
* The **theory of evolution** (misapplied to societies, suggesting some were less evolved) and the **Aryan Invasion Theory** were used to create hierarchies
* Distinguished 'castes' (often seen as descending from Aryan invaders) from 'tribes' (seen as original, primitive inhabitants)
* This cemented divisions

### Indological Approach
* Studying Indian society primarily through ancient **Hindu scriptures**
* This privileged the knowledge of **Brahmins**, who controlled access to and interpretation of these texts
* It tended to present a **Brahminical view** of society as the norm, rationalizing the **caste hierarchy (varna system)** with Brahmins at the top
* It **overlooked other sources of power** and social organization (regional, kinship, political)
* It reinforced the idea that **caste was the unchanging 'essence'** of India

### Early University Departments (Pre-1947)
* Sociology started formally in universities like Bombay (1919), Calcutta, and Lucknow
* Often combined with anthropology

### The Bombay School (G.S. Ghurye)
* Led by Ghurye, heavily influenced by the **Indological approach**
* Focused on identifying a cohesive **'Indian' identity rooted in Hindu civilization**
* Emphasized structures like **caste, kinship, and family** as central
* Strong on empirical description (often based on texts or observations confirming texts) but **lacked strong theoretical development**
* Criticized for promoting a **Hindu-centric view** (cultural nationalism) and using **Eurocentric categories** despite the Indian focus

### The Lucknow School (R. Mukherjee, D.P. Mukherji)
* Distinguished sociology more clearly from anthropology
* Less reliant on colonial methods or purely historical/textual approaches
* More **analytical, empirical (using diverse methods), and interdisciplinary**
* More **oriented towards understanding contemporary India and its future**, rather than just the past (unlike the Bombay School's focus)

## Phase II: Nation-State and the formation of a 'national' sociology (Post-Independence to ~1970s)

### Context
* After independence (1947), the focus shifted to building a modern Indian nation-state
* Sociology was expected to contribute to this project

### M.N. Srinivas
* A dominant figure, influenced by Ghurye but shifted the method
* Emphasized **fieldwork (ethnography)**, particularly **village studies**, rather than relying solely on texts (Indology)
* This was the 'field view' vs. the 'book view'
* Studied the **caste system in action** within villages, examining inter-caste relations and occupations
* Often presented villages as relatively **harmonious functional units**, which became seen as representative of 'Indian society'

#### Criticisms of Srinivas' Approach
* Confused 'village' dynamics with the entirety of 'caste' dynamics across India
* **Excluded or marginalized** groups like tribes, religious minorities, urban populations, and emerging class interests
* Used **functionalist social anthropology** (seeing social structures as contributing to stability), which tended to downplay conflict and inequality
* Maintained a separation between the researcher (often upper-caste) and the researched, without fully analyzing the power dynamics in that relationship
* Introduced key concepts like **Sanskritisation** (lower castes adopting customs of upper castes to try and move up) and **Westernisation** (adoption of Western cultural traits), but these were seen as analyzing change within the existing traditional structure rather than fundamentally challenging it
* His work inadvertently helped **naturalize the 'traditional' character** of Indian society and reinforced a **'Savarna' (upper-caste) perspective** on the nation

### A.R. Desai and the Marxist Approach
* Offered a contrasting perspective
* Used a **Marxist framework** focusing on **class, economic structures, and political economy**
* Analyzed how **capitalist development** (even state-led planning) in post-independence India was creating **new inequalities** and benefiting specific **ruling classes** (bourgeoisie, landed elites)
* Critiqued mainstream 'nationalism' as often serving these dominant class interests
* Studied the **emergence of social movements** (peasant, worker movements) challenging these dominant classes
* Brought in **historical methods** and focused on **change and conflict**, rather than stability and harmony
* Crucially, his approach **included marginalized groups** and issues left out by the dominant village/caste-focused sociology
* Advocated an **interdisciplinary approach**, connecting sociology with history and political economy

## Phase III: Post-1970s (Period of Multiple Challenges)

### Context
* This period saw growing disillusionment and challenges to the post-independence consensus
* **Crisis in Higher Education:** Universities struggled to cope with expansion, regional diversity, and demands from new social groups entering education
* **Social Movements:** The 1970s (especially post-Emergency) and 1980s saw a rise in various movements (environmental, women's, Dalit, regional autonomy, farmers') challenging the state's development model and its authority (as noted by T.K. Oommen)
* The idea of state-led modernization came under fire
* **Globalization and Communalization:** The late 1980s onwards saw the impacts of economic globalization and the rise of religious communalism (especially Hindu nationalism) becoming major social and political forces

### Impact on Sociology
* These challenges forced sociology to broaden its scope and theoretical perspectives

#### Emergence of New Perspectives
* **Subaltern Studies:** Focused on the history and agency of marginalized groups (peasants, workers, Dalits, Adivasis) previously ignored by elite historiography
* **Post-colonial Studies:** Critically examined the enduring legacies of colonialism in culture, knowledge production, and power structures
* **Feminist Critiques:** Highlighted gender inequalities and patriarchal structures within Indian society and within sociology itself
* **Dalit and Adivasi Perspectives:** Brought experiences and analyses of caste oppression and indigenous issues to the forefront, challenging dominant narratives

#### Growth of Interdisciplinary Research
* Fields like media studies and cultural studies gained prominence, reflecting the changing social landscape
* Sociology became more diverse, critical, and engaged with contemporary issues beyond the traditional village/caste framework
