# Sociological Imagination

Introduced to us by C.Wright Mills it's an idea that promotes sociological thinking , now what it means is that to truly understand people's lives, we must look beyond personal experiences and take into account the larger social forces influencing them.

## What is Sociological Imagination?

It's the realization that personal problems ( unemployment , unjust behaviour ) are often not individual failures but a part of a bigger social issue.
It's understanding that society shapes the way you think, act, behave , and it's society who gives you opportunities and experiences.

_“Neither the life of an individual nor the history of a society can be understood without understanding both.”_- C.Wright Mills


## How does it work?

"Sociological Perspective" - Peter Berger
- Berger says we should look beyond the obvious , look deeper into into the questions of why.
- Society seems "natural" but almost all of it is socially constructed by people and history.

"We are a part of bigger system" - Allen Johnson

- We do not act in isolation.
- We're shaped by systems like society, culture, history , gender roles, family norms etc.
- We should actively question, `why` 
  - Why do people behave this way?
  - Is this normal or it has been made to see normal?
  - who benefits from this setup?
