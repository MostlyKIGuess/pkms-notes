The roots of Sociology as a modern discipline:

European Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution
-  Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Newton
- Emergence of the ‘scientific method’
- Evidence, observation, experimentation, measurement, hypothesis
- Erosion in the influence of ‘faith’ and religion
- New ways of thinking, producing knowledge

So it basically arrived from us thinking scientifically about things rather than relying solely on empiricism , as the faith in religion dropped we started believing in society without the fear of god, there is a beautiful quote around this which says 
**" it is not god that keeps the morality in us, it would be very pathetic if humans behaved nice for a seat in heaven"
