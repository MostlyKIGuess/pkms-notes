- You might be wondering, if manim is this code intensive, why manim?
	- The answer might actually be just truly simple in all honesty, because it looks beautiful and you can do various operation which are really really hard in any other software, it is usually recommended to use when you have a hard data set of some sort of a function which is large and humanly hard to understand, and here's Grant explaining what should do: [Grant's Interview with Lex](https://youtu.be/ruUfqQPDdDs?si=nschF0QE_cqaGlFt)

- Here are some cool examples if you are interested:
