# Fallacies

## What is a Fallacy?

- A fallacy is a type of argument that seems to be valid but is flawed or misleading and proves to be false on examination
- A form of argument of argument in which premises "seem" to support a conclusion but do not actually do so, this term is used to refer to familiar patterns of reasoning that are misleading or deceptive
- it's also called "courtroom trick" , category of an argument which doesn't support the conclusion

## Sophistry vs Fallacy

- Sophistry is the art of deluding an audience with arguments that **one knows** to be illogical or misleading.
- On the other hand when an illogical argument is made without the speaker's knowledge of its illogicality, it is called a fallacy.

# Classification of Fallacies

## Fallacies of Relevance

- it's the most common type of fallacy
- the premises of the argument are simply not relevant (lovely) to the conclusion. Although because they are made to be appear relevant, they can deceive.
- they happen when there's no real connection between the premises and the conclusion , because there's no connection the premises can not establish the truth of conclusion

### Examples

- Ad Hominem( argument directed against the person rather than the position they are maintaining)
- Appeal to Authority (an argument that relies on the opinion of someone who is not an expert in the field)
- Appeal to Emotion (an argument that relies on emotional appeal rather than logical reasoning)
- The red herring (a distraction from the argument)
- The straw man (a misrepresentation of an argument to make it easier to attack)

## Fallacies of defective induction

- the mistakes arises from the fact that the "premises" of the argument even though are relevant to conclusion, but are so weak and ineffective that relying on them is a blunder.

### Examples

- The argument from ignorance:
  The Malaysian airlines flight MH370 disappeared without a trace over the Indian Ocean. No conclusive evidence has been found to explain its disappearance. There must be some mysterious force at play.

  - Ancient Aliens argument

- Hasty Generalization
  My uncle has been a chain smoker his entire life and is in perfect health. It is a hoax that smoking causes cancer.

## Fallacies of Presumption

- too much is just assumed in the premises. The inference to the conclusion depends a lot on these unwarranted assumptions

### Examples

- Begging the question
  The Bible is the word of God because God says so in the Bible.
- Complex question
  Have you stopped beating your wife?

## Fallacies of Ambiguity

- the argument is ambiguous, the premises are not clear and can be interpreted in different ways. The ambiguity can be in the words used or in the structure of the argument itself.
- the incorrect reasoning in fallacies arises from the "equivocal use of words of phrases"

### Examples

- Equivocation
  The sign said "fine for parking here," and since it was fine, I parked there.
  IQ is a measure of intelligence. I have a high IQ, therefore I am intelligent.

- Amphiboly ( things that can be taken in a same way )
  “Call me a taxi.” Explanation: This could be a request to summon a taxi cab, but it could also be interpreted as a request to be referred to as “a taxi.”
- Accent
  "Terms and conditions apply" - this could mean that the terms and conditions are important, or it could mean that they are not important. The meaning depends on the emphasis placed on the words.

## Some common fallacies

- Ad hominem: A fallacy that depends on an attack against the person making a claim instead of the claim that is being made.
- Straw man: exaggerating or misrepresenting the claims of the opposition in order to more easily appear to refute those claims.
- Circular argument: when the premise and the conclusion are different sentences expressing the same proposition
- Equivocation: The fallacy of equivocation occurs when we change the meaning of a word in the middle of an argument
- Distinction w/o a difference: a fallacy that occurs when we try to draw a distinction between two things that are not, in fact, distinct
