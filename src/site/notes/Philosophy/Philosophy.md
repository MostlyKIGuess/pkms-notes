# What is Philosophy?

- Not see philosophy as itself, see it as how it interconnects with other social sciences
- Philosophy = love + wisdom.
  - The roots of "philosophy" lie in the Greek words _philos_ (love) and _sophia_ (wisdom). Th
    ink ancient Greek thinkers seeking to understand the universe and human existence through r
    easoned inquiry. The concept's origins are deeply embedded in Greek philosophy's history.
- Philosophy is categorized as a second order discipline. ( we think about how we think )
- Bread and butter of philosophy is argument, how do you come to an conclusion through an argument

## Why study philosophy?

- It is one of the oldest discipline.
- Reason and Argue and Disagree.
- Examples
  - dunning-kruger is an example
  - Socrates Quotes etc.
    - "_The unecamined life is not worth living_"

## What is a philosophical question?

- **Normative vs Descriptive**

  - Normative philosophy explores _how things ought to be_, descriptive examines _how things are_. Think ideals vs. realities.

- Thought Experiments are philosophical questions ( einstein is really good at this shit)

## Domains of Philosophy

### Logic

- What is right reasoning?
- Example: Analyzing arguments like "All humans are mortal; Socrates is human; therefore, Socrates is mortal" to identify valid reasoning patterns and fallacies.
- Logic provides tools to distinguish sound arguments from flawed ones, much like mathematics for reasoning.

### Epistemology

- How is knowledge possible?
- Example: Questioning how we know the external world exists beyond our perceptions - can we trust our senses or is knowledge justified through reasoning?
- Explores the difference between believing something and truly knowing it.

### Ontology and Metaphysics

- What exists?
- What is the relation between mind and world?
- Example: Debating whether numbers exist independently or are human constructs, or whether consciousness can be reduced to brain activity.
- Investigates fundamental questions about reality beyond what science can empirically test.

### Ethics

- What is right or wrong? Good or Bad?
- Example: Considering whether it's ethical to lie to protect someone's feelings, or examining if an action's morality depends on its consequences or inherent nature.
- Provides frameworks for making moral decisions beyond cultural customs.

### Axiology

- What is value?
- Example: Questioning whether economic value reflects intrinsic worth, or if some things (like human dignity) have value regardless of utility.
- Examines how we determine what matters and why.

### Aesthetics

- What is beauty?
- Example: Analyzing why we find certain music beautiful while others don't, or whether beauty is objective or purely subjective.
- Explores artistic expression and our responses to it beyond personal preference.

### Philosophy of x

- Where x = law, economics, history, society, technology, politics, sport, etc.
- Examples: Questioning whether AI can have rights (philosophy of technology), examining what makes laws just (philosophy of law), or analyzing if markets should be completely free (philosophy of economics).
- Applies philosophical thinking to specific domains of human activity.
