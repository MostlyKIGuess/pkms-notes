Hey, Haelloo.

Anywhere you don't understand why it happened consider googling , especially because a lot of this is just taken from google, SEO of the citations should be good enough ;).

Now that that's cleared through. Because Audio Amplifier is divided into 4 parts , ofcourse like a human being I tried to do it in 4 divisions.
