## Classical: The Market remains free, competition auto balances it. 

### Invisible Hand (Free Market) ( Adam Smith)

- Believes in the invisible hand that guides the market if the demand/supply decreases. (comes from Wealth of Nation by Adam Smith)
- Workers, Capitalists and landlords are the key class structure in this idea.
- If everyone acts on their selfish intent the market will be good for all because this invisible hand will guide it to manage itself, and government shouldn't interfere here.

### Say's Law 

- Supply creates it's own demand.

### Comparative Advantage ( Ricardo )

- Each state( nation ) should be more focused on what they are comparatively better at , this will be better for the market.
- For example, if Britain is making cotton, wine and ships and France is making Cotton and Wine, but France is better at making Wine compared to Britain, then Britain should focus more on making cotton(being good at what they specialize.)  It strengths the free trade .
- Maximize output for all the nations that are involved in free trade.

### Limitations:
- Say's Law is just wrong, doesn't account for macroeconomics issues like unemployment,recession( he just denies that recession will never happen if we continue to free trade )
## Neo-Classical : Individuals are rational beings so give them independence, until and unless market is stable.

### Labour Theory of Value
- It says that the value of a product(commodity) is determined by the amount of time/effort ( labor) has been put into it.
- ( Neo-Classical Doesn't Believe in that btw)
- Neo-Classical would say, just because something is really hard to make doesn't mean it's worth more.
- _Marshall: demands matter short-run, supply matter long-run._
### Analytics
- Uses analytics , calculus and mathematics in general to analyze the market.
- Assumes people are rational actors and make decision to maximize their satisfaction ( utility ) given their limited resources.
### Marginalism
- an economic law that states that all else being equal , as consumption increases , satisfaction decreases from each additional unit. 
### General equilibrium theory
