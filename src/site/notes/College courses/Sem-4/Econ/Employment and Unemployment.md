- **Employment** is a factor in macroeconomic health of a country.
- More employment -> Decent Quality Life for most people.
- Tracked using unemployment rate tho.


#### Unemployment Rate:
- The percentage of working age adults actively looking for employment ( labour force ) but not getting it at any given time.
- higher unemployment rate -> economic crisis in country.


# Inflation

- **Definition :** 
$$\frac{P^{t}_{b} - P^{t-1}_{b}}{P^{t-1}}\cdot100$$

- t -> current year, b -> base year

- A trade-off between inflation and unemployment was first identified by A.W.Philips leading to the so called (negativly sloped) Philips curve.
