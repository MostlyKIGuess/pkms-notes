# Right Person, Wrong Time

### Love is messy, time is ruthless.

You meet someone. Maybe it’s in a coffee shop, a random Instagram DM, a library aisle where your hands reach for the same book. A spark. A connection. It feels different. Feels right. But then life does what life does best—it gets in the way.

Maybe they have to move to another city.  
Maybe you're both too young, too lost, too busy trying to become who you need to be.  
Maybe one of you is healing while the other is hurting.  

And that’s the tragedy of *right person, wrong time*.  

It’s this cruel joke the universe plays where it lets you see what could be, but won’t let you keep it. Like finding the perfect song and then realizing it’s not on Spotify. Like waking up from the best dream of your life, trying to go back to sleep, but it’s gone.

### So what do you do?

Some people wait. They tell themselves, *if it's meant to be, it will be*. They romanticize the idea of fate, of things falling into place later. 

Others let go, painfully, knowing that timing isn't just a detail—it’s everything. 

Because the right love at the wrong time is just a beautiful ghost. You can see it, feel it, but you can’t hold onto it.  

### The real kicker? 

There’s no guarantee that time will ever be right. No rule that says *ten years from now, when we’re older, wiser, freer, it will work out*. That’s just another story we tell ourselves to soften the heartbreak.

Camus had this idea of the absurd—the tension between what we want the world to be and what it actually is. Maybe *right person, wrong time* is the absurdity of love. The mind saying *this should work*, the world saying *nope*.

So maybe the answer isn’t waiting or mourning or holding onto *what ifs*. Maybe the answer is just *living*. Moving forward, letting the right person at the wrong time be a lesson instead of a life sentence.

Because at the end of the day, love isn’t just about finding the right person.  

It’s about finding them *at the right time*.
