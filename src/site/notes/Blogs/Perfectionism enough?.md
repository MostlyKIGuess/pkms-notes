# AHHHHHHHHHH

I will title this as

## Art of Screaming into the void

or

## Why I never finish anything

You will realize why both makes sense at the end of it.

### Introduction - The Paradox

- I love raw , imperfect ideas , but when I put them out, they have to be _perfect_.
- The strange feeling of _thinking_ of building / finishing that imperfect idea is just too sweet to actually do it.
- The Absurdity of all of this is once you actually stick through it and even finish it you would feel a disconnect sort of distant from whatever you did.

## Sweetness of Potential

- Ohhhh baby, this is sweeter than anything you will ever feel, the idea of creating a novel thing, never been done, an idea so real and yours even you think to yourself, _how did you come up with that?_
- Idea is a masterpiece and dogshit until it remains unfinished, it's the Schrodinger's cat.
- There’s this scene in _Kafka on the Shore_ where Kafka is stuck in a library, trapped in his own story. That’s what unfinished projects feel like—safe ,limitless, but also suffocating.
- Once you finish something, it’s no longer infinite. It’s just _one_ thing.

## The Fear of Completion

- Starting is easy. Finishing means committing to a version of reality.
- Unfinished projects are a defense mechanism: you can’t fail at something that doesn’t exist. You just can not be criticized if it's not out yet.
- And it's not the fear of others, do not get me wrong my friend, it's _yourself_, because once your reality is set, the power to dream _infinite_ goes away and it breaks you down.

## The Ghost of Finished Work

- Just like in Stranger, how it's about getting detached, that is _exactly_ what happens once the work is done.
- How I feel looking at something I _finally_ finish—it’s like a stranger inside of me made it.
- I used to think I just lost interest, but maybe it’s because the thing I made is no longer _mine_ in the way an idea is. ( _The Death of the Author_ )

## The Absurdity of It All

- If starting is thrilling, and finishing is empty, then why create at all?
- We create, we abandon, we restart. And maybe that’s the point.
- Just maybe all that accumulates to a better sleep, a hug by a breeze, the love by a dog, just simple things.
- Maybe unfinished things aren’t failures. Maybe they’re just echoes of what could have been, and that’s enough. yes that is in fact Enough.

I will shut up for now and scream into the _void_.

## Learning to Scream into the Void

- Instead of chasing “completion,” maybe I _should_ embrace the mess.
- Maybe some things are meant to stay unfinished, like half-written songs or half-read books or songs you would only listen once.
- And maybe that’s not a tragedy. Maybe that’s just how art works.

And Maybe at the end of it all, I will finish what I finally want to finish, the beautiful art that I paint everyday by living this life.
