# Thoughts During the Movie


The moment I started watching, and  3 mins into this film and the first thing I read

> "Sand is overrated, it's just tiny little rocks. If only I can meet someone new, I guess my chances of that happening are _somewhat_ diminished seeing that I'm incapable of making eye contact with a woman Idk"- the male lead actor. 

Put that into the words of wisdom please - Lecrec :nerd: :fingerup:

:sob: bro mentioned Naomi, watching Wolf of wall street before this isn't helping at all omggg . ( that was so mid ew)

that is so beautiful , I have no words

FUCK THIS PATRICK GUY 

>"You know me, I am impulse, THAT"S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT YOU" - Joel

aww


HMMMM Ok so she said
> "Hide me in your humiliation"

Does that mean she already knew what is the procedure like? I mean hell yeah she knows what's the procedure because she has done it, and she wanted to know more about him, because she is upset why he doesn't talk that much? 
Weirdest of them all is, how is she communicating in the thoughts of Joel..

BWAHHAHAHAH

It is very sweet how this could be a way of communication, going deeper together with your significant other is a pretty darn thing to experience.


I have a question tho? If he is sure he has mapped all of Clem, why not go to a place with Naomi in it? it would be even harder to find

hmm ok, more questions who is the fucking doc, why is that girl liking him? did he pull a patrick on that girl, and why is that stan guy being a cuck WTF?

OK I THINK I UNDERSTAND NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO THE STARTING 30 mins were CLEMS MEMORY AND THATS WHY PATRICK shued my guy Joel away from his car saying what are you doing here, AHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Ahhhh wait I might be wrong, he wants to leave that house as well, David and Ruth am I missing a reference here, ahhhhhh I am dumb, not wrong about it's memories of each other on starting of the movie, but I am still confused why they are acting different, words are exchanged on characters. NO no I wasn't missing anything, I am just overthinking.
This bottom image came just now ->
