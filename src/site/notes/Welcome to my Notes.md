Hi!!
This might be a little hard to navigate at first, but just look at the graph and try searching through things, you will find your way.

Welcome to my tiny corner of the web, where I do random knowledge I’ve picked up along the way. Whether you're into coding, physics, or just curious about learning in general, you might enjoy a look around.

This site’s all about *growing ideas* (to cringe on them later on) and documenting the stuff I’m working on , I am planning to add music theory, philosophy and more of some linux stuff in general, but I am not ready yet to publish them yet. As of now the content I have added is  here [[Welcome to my Notes#Explore My Notes\|Welcome to my Notes#Explore My Notes]].

## Explore My Notes

- [[Blogs/Blogs\|Blogs]] ( Well, blogs, I stopped reading and writing, so don't expect much)
- [[Manim/Manim\|Manim]] (Documentation of the library which is famously used by 3b1b)
- [[Classical Mechanics/Classical Mechanics\|Classical Mechanics]] (welp never knew I would enjoy this)
- [[ML/ML\|ML]] ( machine learning, idk jackshit why would anyone click here)
- [[VLSI/VLSI\|VLSI]]  ( very large scale ~~headache~~ integration)
- [[Classical Mechanics/Classical Mechanics\|Classical Mechanics]] ( This leads to a good rabbit hole in natural science which is so out of the whole site, COZ IT WAS A FORCED COURSE, _sigh_ , it was interesting although )
- [[College courses/Sem-4/Econ/Economics\|Economics]] ( fun basics , although you are better of reading Freakonomist or The User's Guide to Economics )
- [[Philosophy/Philosophy\|Philosophy]] ( _THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE WHOLE SITE ABOUT BUT I AM NOT GETTING THE TIME TO WRITE , glad this course had some aspects of it, not the philosophy I enjoy tho, hmu if you wanna talk about 19th century philosophers_)
- [[LLMs/LLM Understanding\|LLM Understanding]] ( i like self-attention )
- [[Movies/Movies\|Movies]] ( I started this very recently and am not gonna finish it lmao)
Then there's random stuff on Interesting folder which isn't organized but welp have fun. [[Interesting/Docker <3\|Docker <3]] , [[Interesting/PSD\|PSD]] , etc.

This site is constantly growing as I learn more, so check back for updates. If you have any suggestions or want to discuss anything, feel free to reach out. Mail is there on the bottom right

## What's This Site For?

Think of it as a personal collection of notes and docs. Instead of letting everything get lost in random files, I keep it all here for easy access and reference. Especially the ones ik I am going to forget very soon.

If you aren't familiar with pkms, here's a good starting point <https://www.reddit.com/r/PKMS/> .
