Hi!! 
This might be a little hard to navigate at first, but just look at the graph and try searching through things, you will find your way.

Welcome to my tiny corner of the web, where I do random knowledge I’ve picked up along the way. Whether you're into coding, physics, or just curious about learning in general, you might enjoy a look around.

This site’s all about **growing ideas** and documenting the stuff I’m working on planning to add music theory, philosophy and more of some linux stuff in general, but I am not ready yet to publish them yet. As of now the content I have added is  here [](.md#Explore%20My%20Notes).

## What's This Site For?

Think of it as a personal collection of notes and docs. Instead of letting everything get lost in random files, I keep it all here for easy access and reference. Especially the ones ik I am going to forget very soon.

If you aren't familiar with pkms, here's a good starting point https://www.reddit.com/r/PKMS/ .

## Tips & Tricks

1. **Graph View**: Use the graph view to get a visual overview of how all the topics and notes are connected. It helps you see the relationships between concepts and ideas.

2. **Dark Mode**: Prefer working at night? You can switch to dark mode anytime for a more comfortable reading experience.

3. **Quick Search (Ctrl + K)**: If you’re looking for something specific, use `Ctrl + K` to open the search bar and find any page or note quickly.

4. **Make Your Own Notes**: This content is based on my perspective, but you can build your own interpretations by adding to or modifying these notes. Check Source [here](https://github.com/MostlyKIGuess/pkms-notes).
